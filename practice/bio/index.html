      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Born in 1891 in Los Angeles, California, Earl Warren served in the
          military during WWI and later became a county district attorney. He
          won election to his home state's governorship, holding that position
          from 1943 until 1953, and was then appointed chief justice of the
          U.S. Supreme Court. Warren led the Court through many landmark cases
          dealing with race, justice, and representation. After John F.
          Kennedy's assassination, Warren headed the investigating commission.
          He retired from the bench in 1969 and died in 1974 in Washington, D.C.            <!-- Line breaks don't matter. -->

          In the Brown v. Board of Education decision (1954): "In the field
          of public education, the doctrine of 'separate but equal' has no
          place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal."
